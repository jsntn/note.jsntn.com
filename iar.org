Many years ago, on a whim, I wrote a little something - a TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt
launcher. Little did I know at the time that this piece of code would become the
starting point of my journey into heavy encryption.

The time when the story began feels distant now. For the purpose of privacy
protection, I was searching for a reliable encryption software, and TrueCrypt
became my choice, until 2014, I switched to VeraCrypt.

> (*) Reason: https://jsntn.com/software/2014/06/01/truecrypt.html, in fact, I
am still using both TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt simultaneously.

However, the tedious process of opening the software, selecting the encrypted
volume, entering the password, and manually mounting the disk every time made me
tired. I needed a simple and efficient way to manage my encrypted volumes, so I
started conceptualizing and designing a launcher.

Then, in 2021, I open-sourced this launcher and put it on
https://github.com/jsntn/veracrypt-launcher.

I have polished it over the years, using and iterating continuously, and I
believe it has become a very complete version now.

This launcher has many highlights, let me tell you about them one by one:

- First of all, it is a portable application, with no need for troublesome
  installation. With just one click, you can happily use it.

- Secondly, I have built-in support for TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, making it easy for
  you to encrypt your data.

- Moreover, the launcher has a fantastic feature. By using corresponding batch
  files, you can easily mount volumes in read-only or read/write mode, giving
  your data the best protection in different scenarios.

- Not only that, the launcher also supports a single configuration INI file,
  allowing you to customize your decryption settings.

- Furthermore, you can specify a specific drive or let the launcher
  automatically find an available drive letter.

- Lastly, I can proudly tell you that it is very stable and reliable.

Today, I cautiously released version 0.1.0 of this launcher, which is my first
step towards perfection. I consider it a gift for you, who, like me, love
privacy and encryption.

If you don't know what TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt is, I recommend you to learn about it
immediately. It can effectively protect your personal privacy and important
data. To put it in a grander way, it is not just a tool, but a manifestation of
values.

However, if you find that VeraCrypt is not useful for you after using it, I can
give you some advice to help you discover its applicable scenarios:

- You can use it as a storage volume for your portable software, protecting your
  data privacy.

- When you need to handle fragmented files, it can also serve as your storage
  volume, solving the efficiency and encryption issues of cloud synchronization.

- You can also combine it with external hard drives or NAS for more stringent
  data protection.

Don't forget, these scenarios can be easily implemented on your personal
devices. And with the help of the launcher on the PC platform, starting
TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt becomes even quicker and more convenient.

I even feel that everyone should use VeraCrypt-like software to encrypt their
data on their personal devices. It should be used even more on non-personal
devices because we are unsure and cannot control their security.

Finally, I have said so much.

This little launcher, carrying my love for privacy protection, will continue to
accompany me every day on my PC.

In the virtual world, both illusory and real.
