<p>
我用纯文本文件记录着一些习惯养成的日志，每天确认实践了的事项并一一划掉。
</p>

<p>
每当这时，我都会想到张二冬写的一段话：
</p>

<p>
我总希望每一天，每一年，都像摘果子一样，有些收获，这样的话，到了五十，知天命的年龄，一定是很坦然的，因为回忆起来，是厚厚的一生。</p>]]></description>

<p>
经过 4 个月不长也不算短的努力，12 次迭代，我们的第一个正式版今天发出去了。老陈建议我去买挂鞭庆祝一下，我仔细一想，还是算了吧，毕竟这事儿还没完呢。
</p>

<p>
上午，哥几个一起再一次过了每一个细节的进展，确认了看板的 milestone，还差 21%，但是上帝们等不了了。
</p>

<p>
下班前，我们把长达 71 页的 user guide 定稿，并发送给了客户。没发布的时候，我多么期待这一天。我说，提交出去的一刻，像送别一个旅人，想想它即将直面一切，又心生难舍。老陈看着我，目光直视内心，轻轻说道——菩提祖师传悟空驾云变身之术，对他恩义如山，送别悟空时说，日后你若惹出什么祸来……
</p>

<p>
回望这 4 个月，打开 git 的历史，点点滴滴的提交记录像一本书，记载我们的每一步，心中开心交织着遗憾，织成了一段沉甸甸的回忆。
</p>

<p>
不知道说些什么，也不知道应该从哪里说起，我想了半天，跟兄弟们说——咱是真牛逼啊！

If you're reading this, you have my thanks. But let's be honest: I can't know
what you like. Every human product that's really worth reading or seeing or
hearing is made mostly to please its human producer. Because if you aim to
please the world you usually miss, the target's just too big and you can only
guess where it is&#x2026;

<p>
Oh, the pursuit of perfection to one's needs, my dear reader, is a noble and
enticing endeavor. How often have we found ourselves dissatisfied with the
offerings of others, not because they were lacking in quality, but simply
because they did not align exactly with our unique desires?
</p>

<p>
Such was my predicament when I embarked on a quest to find the perfect package
to my requirements, one that would cater to my specific needs. I delved into the
sea of options, hoping to discover a gem that would captivate me in ways beyond
imagination. Alas, despite encountering several commendable contenders, none
could fulfill the specific expectations I had set upon them.
</p>

<p>
It was not a matter of their inadequacy or their inherent flaws; quite the
contrary, these packages were exceptional in their own right. However, my heart
yearned for something else and more, something that would cater to my
idiosyncratic requests. And so, embracing the spirit of creativity and
curiosity, I ventured forth into the realm of creation.
</p>

<p>
Ah, the art of forging one's own path, designing a realm tailored to one's
desires - it is both liberating and daunting. With jumbled thoughts and visions
swirling in my mind, I harnessed my determination and set about the arduous task
of crafting my own package, one that would satisfy my simple yet profound needs.
</p>

<p>
Time passed, and my labor of love took shape. With each stroke of the keyboard
and every line of code, I breathed life into my creation, shaping it into a
tangible embodiment of my aspirations. And finally, after countless hours of
toil and unwavering dedication, my creation stood before me - a manifestation of
my desires, manifested in the digital realm.
</p>

<p>
So here it stands, my dear reader, the culmination of my endeavors. A package
born from the depths of my imagination, with every intricate detail tailored to
perfection. It is not the most intricate or grandiose, but it is uniquely mine -
a testament to the power of willful creation.
</p>

<p>
Thus, I present to you my creation, a testament to the pursuit of individuality
and the refusal to settle for existing offerings. May it inspire you to embark
on your own creative journey, for within the realm of personalization lies the
true essence of satisfaction and fulfillment.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">My Use Case</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It was a chilly autumn morning when I found myself immersed in my
study, surrounded by books and the captivating allure of the
written word. The faint smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted
through the air, mingling with the faint scent of old paper. My
attention fixated on the work on my Emacs, and I know its
background process is filtering all my tasks to let me know which
ones are about to be revealed.
</p>

<p>
Wrapped in the cocoon of my obsession with organization, I had
meticulously crafted a schedule utilizing the remarkable
abilities of Emacs. This digital mastermind would dutifully
execute the commands of a script named org-task-scheduler.el, a
creation born out of my desire for efficiency and productivity.
</p>

<p>
From the depths of my being, a voice dictated the rules: "Let the
timer begin its relentless countdown, working days from 10AM to
6PM, every 15 minutes." And so it was set, like a grand symphony
of time management merging with the rhythmic ticking of a clock.
</p>

<p>
With each passing moment, my dedication to this endeavor
deepened. The tasks that complied with the criteria I had
painstakingly configured would be captured and recorded in a file
named tasks.org. This sacred shrine of productivity would
transcend the boundaries of my study, for it would be synced
through a cloud drive. This synchronized bond would allow me the
convenience of accessing my tasks on any of my trusted devices, a
modern marvel connecting me with my own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Yet, productivity existed not solely in the realm of organization
and documentation. Aware of the intrinsic value of deadlines and
the urgency they inspire, I had engineered a pop-up to ensure my
attention remained undivided on the tasks. Kind of alarms, sweet
sirens of time's passage, would resound with purpose, piercing
the silence of my study. They would alert me as tasks approached
their scheduled starting time or solemnly stood at the threshold
of their unforgiving deadlines.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the irony of it all! The pursuit of productivity defined my
days, but was I not merely a marionette controlled by the strings
of time? I had harnessed its power, bending it to my will, yet I
was forever beholden to the very entity I sought to conquer.
</p>

<p>
As the minutes dwindled and the day pressed on, I surrendered to
the rhythmic cycle of productivity. The creation had distilled
the essence of discipline and structure into a simple script,
guiding my every move, every thought.
</p>

<p>
In the depths of my study, amidst the organized chaos of my
thoughts and the silent clicking of keys, I found solace. The
world outside faded into insignificance as I lost myself in the
symphony of productivity, conductor of my own destiny, driven by
the relentless pursuit of efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Such is the life I have chosen, a life governed by timers,
alarms, and the unquenchable thirst for accomplishment. In the
end, it is not the tasks completed or the deadlines met that
define me, but the passion and devotion with which I approach
them. And so, I continue my journey, embracing the embrace of
productivity's sweet embrace.

        <title>A fix to copy-paste across VM and Host by Emacs</title>
        <link>https://note.jsntn.com/copy-paste-by-emacs.html</link>
        <guid></guid>
        <pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 01:06:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <description><![CDATA[

<p>
The copy and paste between virtual machines and host machines on the Windows
system always requires the installation of various compatibility issue plugins,
and even requires several attempts and restarts. Even after switching to
Vagrant, this copy and paste feature is still not perfect.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, I wrote some Emacs Lisp code to solve this problem.
</p>

<p>
The idea is very straightforward: using two text files, one to record the
content of the host machine's clipboard for the virtual machine to read, and
another to record the copy content of the virtual machine for the host machine
to read. Then, a scheduled task is set up on both the host machine and the
virtual machine to read and update the content.
</p>

<p>
The drawback is that text files only support plain text content. It is not
effective for rich text content and file copy and paste.
</p>

<p>
The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jsntn/emacs.d/blob/3f19f57372b7315f06f5c8ed6991a175837d60ac/lisp/init-misc.el#L33L140">here</a>. No additional plugins or dependencies are required,
just paste it into Emacs and run it directly.
</p>

<p>
With this setup, I can copy on my Windows host machine and then switch to the
virtual machine to directly paste; copy in the virtual machine and then paste it
in the host machine. It works very smoothly.
</p>

<p>
My copy and paste operations with window switching take about 1.5 to 2.5
seconds, and the minimum synchronization interval for each copy and paste task
between the host machine and the virtual machine is 2 seconds. This time is
obviously not perfect, but it is extremely suitable for me and my work computer.

        <title>Emacs 三年</title>
        <link>https://note.jsntn.com/emacs-3-years.html</link>

        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 17:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <description><![CDATA[

<p>
潜心修炼 Emacs 和 Emacs Lisp 已经 3 年多，我经常会感觉自己一直在原地打转，并为此困惑不已。
</p>

<p>
直到今天，源于一个我从 2021 年开始启用的有道词典在线插件，今天发现它开始出服务器错误提示了。对此我其实是一点都不意外，因为我现在已经坚信「简单化」和「本地化」才是王道。何不借此机会，干脆写一个 function 直接调用我本地的 GoldenDict 呢？直觉告诉我，这应该不难。
</p>

<p>
而这“直觉”属实让我兴奋和惊喜！要知道 1 年前这种想法我是想都不敢想的。
</p>

<p>
于是，大概 10 分钟后，我就有了<a href="https://github.com/jsntn/emacs.d/blob/2faac38bfb664eacfc582fb8cbf9f30c72102662/lisp/init-dict.el#L7L29">这样</a>的一段代码。
</p>

<p>
至此，我终于感到自己并没有在原地打转。
</p>

<p>
因为山始终在那里，可它的影像于我确已清晰。
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
I have been devoted to mastering Emacs and Emacs Lisp for over 3 years now, but
I often feel like I'm spinning my wheels and it confuses me.
</p>

<p>
Until today, when I encountered a server error message from the Youdao
Dictionary online plugin that I started using in 2021. I wasn't surprised at all
because now I firmly believe that "simplicity" and "localization" are the way to
go. So why not take this opportunity and write a function to directly call my
local GoldenDict? My intuition tells me that it shouldn't be difficult.
</p>

<p>
And this intuition truly excites and surprises me! You see, a year ago, I
wouldn't have dared to entertain such an idea.
</p>

<p>
So, about 10 minutes later, I had <a href="https://github.com/jsntn/emacs.d/blob/2faac38bfb664eacfc582fb8cbf9f30c72102662/lisp/init-dict.el#L7L29">this</a> piece of code.
</p>

<p>
And now, I finally feel like I'm not spinning my wheels anymore.
</p>

<p>
Because the mountain is always there, but its image has become clear to me.

        <title>亦幻亦真/Illusory and Real</title>
        <link>https://note.jsntn.com/iar.html</link>

        <description><![CDATA[

<p>
Many years ago, on a whim, I wrote a little something - a TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt
launcher. Little did I know at the time that this piece of code would become the
starting point of my journey into heavy encryption.
</p>

<p>
The time when the story began feels distant now. For the purpose of privacy
protection, I was searching for a reliable encryption software, and TrueCrypt
became my choice, until 2014, I switched to VeraCrypt.
</p>

<p>
&gt; (*) Reason: <a href="https://jsntn.com/software/2014/06/01/truecrypt.html">https://jsntn.com/software/2014/06/01/truecrypt.html</a>, in fact, I
am still using both TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
However, the tedious process of opening the software, selecting the encrypted
volume, entering the password, and manually mounting the disk every time made me
tired. I needed a simple and efficient way to manage my encrypted volumes, so I
started conceptualizing and designing a launcher.
</p>

<p>
Then, in 2021, I open-sourced this launcher and put it on
<a href="https://github.com/jsntn/veracrypt-launcher">https://github.com/jsntn/veracrypt-launcher</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have polished it over the years, using and iterating continuously, and I
believe it has become a very complete version now.
</p>

<p>
This launcher has many highlights, let me tell you about them one by one:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First of all, it is a portable application, with no need for troublesome
installation. With just one click, you can happily use it.
</li>

<li>Secondly, I have built-in support for TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, making it easy for
you to encrypt your data.
</li>

<li>Moreover, the launcher has a fantastic feature. By using corresponding batch
files, you can easily mount volumes in read-only or read/write mode, giving
your data the best protection in different scenarios.
</li>

<li>Not only that, the launcher also supports a single configuration INI file,
allowing you to customize your decryption settings.
</li>

<li>Furthermore, you can specify a specific drive or let the launcher
automatically find an available drive letter.
</li>

<li>Lastly, I can proudly tell you that it is very stable and reliable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Today, I cautiously released version 0.1.0 of this launcher, which is my first
step towards perfection. I consider it a gift for you, who, like me, love
privacy and encryption.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know what TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt is, I recommend you to learn about it
immediately. It can effectively protect your personal privacy and important
data. To put it in a grander way, it is not just a tool, but a manifestation of
values.
</p>

<p>
However, if you find that VeraCrypt is not useful for you after using it, I can
give you some advice to help you discover its applicable scenarios:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can use it as a storage volume for your portable software, protecting your
data privacy.
</li>

<li>When you need to handle fragmented files, it can also serve as your storage
volume, solving the efficiency and encryption issues of cloud synchronization.
</li>

<li>You can also combine it with external hard drives or NAS for more stringent
data protection.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Don't forget, these scenarios can be easily implemented on your personal
devices. And with the help of the launcher on the PC platform, starting
TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt becomes even quicker and more convenient.
</p>

<p>
I even feel that everyone should use VeraCrypt-like software to encrypt their
data on their personal devices. It should be used even more on non-personal
devices because we are unsure and cannot control their security.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I have said so much.
</p>

<p>
This little launcher, carrying my love for privacy protection, will continue to
accompany me every day on my PC.
</p>

<p>
In the virtual world, both illusory and real.

When I was organizing my bookshelf, I intended to sell some books. However, when I opened them up and flipped through a few pages, almost every book brought back a memory for me. It's just like how a song can take you back to an unforgettable moment from the past. It was a Southern Sunday morning, with a refreshing breeze and the air filled with delightful scents&#x2026;</p>]]></description>

最近几天在 PC 上使用 Emacs over Ubuntu(by Vagrant)，terminal 终端是 Alacritty，整体体验非常好。整理了一个 Vagrantfile 可以快速 set up 一个基于 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 的 Emacs 28，同时安装了 fzf 和 tmux，我的 Alacritty 配置和主题也一并分享在这里 <a href="https://github.com/jsntn/emacs-vagrantfile">https://github.com/jsntn/emacs-vagrantfile</a>，其他细节可见其中的 deploy/bootstrap.sh

我现在已经不再买电子书了，倔强的亚马逊都退出了，实在不敢想象这虚拟的不确定性了，Stallman 他老人家说得都是至理名言。但离线电子书文件还是会看的，从阅读角度来说，这本就与实体书并不互斥，就好比实体唱片和离线音乐电子文件的关系。这里面当然不包括实体物件所能带来的感觉，这又好比人不可以活在虚拟的世界太久，再真实的感觉，也还是虚拟的现实。而也不应当偏执于现实，毕竟“一个人只拥有此生此世是不够的，他还应该拥有诗意的世界”。

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-04 Sun 18:00]</span></span> 有一个原则是对于非 A 即 B 的设置/分类，一定要用文件夹，而不是标签🏷️。
</p>

<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-03 Sat 23:42]</span></span> 「晒书房」停止以后，我曾花了一些时间去查找它的替代应用，并反思我到底需要一个什么样的图书管理工具。想来想去有这几点：
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>离线服务
</li>
<li>跨平台数据，支持备份恢复
</li>
<li>跨平台使用友好
</li>
<li>分类和标签
</li>
<li>搜索
</li>
</ol>

<p>
直到今天使用 KeePassium 的时候我突然想到——何不用 KeePass 数据库来做这件事情呢？！[微笑]我先测试一段时间看看～

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-05 Mon 22:48]</span></span> 今天 disable 了 refile targets cache。然后 lsp-grammarly
的问题似乎也好了[doge]……同时我增加了 lsp-mode 的配置，和 3 个 package：lsp-ui，
helm-org-ql 和 lsp-treemacs。ALL THESE MADE MY DAY.[微笑]
</p>

<p>
我也整理了 KeePass 数据库，iOS 上借助 Fantasy Pass 维护管理，一个反手我把其存于坚果云的数据库和 NAS 同步也配了。
</p>

<p>
这还没完，Org 9 的 org-file-apps .mp4 打开的问题我也搞好了，哈哈哈哈哈
</p>

<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-03 Sat 12:45]</span></span> 几个关于 refile cache 的待研究的参考文档
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220829071422/https://yiming.dev/blog/2018/03/02/my-org-refile-workflow/">https://web.archive.org/web/20220829071422/https://yiming.dev/blog/2018/03/02/my-org-refile-workflow/</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-02 Fri 22:48]</span></span> 我把 refile target 的 maxlevel 从 9 改为了 4，观察一段时间看看，当然我也觉得这不是真正的解决问题的办法。[doge]
</p>

<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-02 Fri 19:01]</span></span> 我今天发现 lsp-grammarly 有点问题，似乎和 projectile 有点关系，然后 refile targets cache 也卡住了……太棒了！

<p>
我今天早上列今天 GTD 的时候就告诉自己-&#x2014;我今天一定要把 Org-roam 的 v1 到 v2 的迁移问题解决掉！
</p>

<p>
然后今天上午我就开始想-&#x2014;既然本质是 plain text 的话为什么不尝试下 Obsidian 呢？给它一个机会，也给自己多一个选择。然后我就开始试用了，然后就发现了一些问题……
</p>

<p>
尝试解决过程中，我看到了 Logseq，这货不仅 plain text，甚至更加凶残地直接支持 Org 文件！简直就是 Emacs 用户的不二之选有没有！
</p>

<p>
就在我即将冲动的时候，我突然想到了既然选它就是为了 Org，那为什么不回到 Org-roam 呢？……
</p>

<p>
就这样转了一个大圈，现在是北京时间 20:45，我又看到 GTD list 里面的 Org-roam 静静地立在那里，它顶着羚羊的大脸，一言不发，笑眯眯的眼神里却轻蔑地透出两个字-&#x2014;诱惑，随后口里轻轻吐出-&#x2014;明天见……
</p>

<p>
我觉得这件事给我的教训就是-&#x2014;不管什么时候都不能忘了自己为什么出发，这花花世界滚滚红尘的诱惑太多了……要定得住！
</p>

<p>
在 Org-roam 这件事上，什么阿尔卑斯山上融化的积雪，蓝色的湖泊里飘荡的雾气，高山上怒放的花朵和迎风站立领口张开的姑娘……和 Emacs 没关系的都给我去一边的。
</p>

<p>
明天见！
</p>

<p>
#我得把这件事记下来不然我就忘了

一起做项目的小伙伴要离开去另一个项目了，平时在项目中的 packaging 几乎都是他在帮忙完成的，工作上除了有时马虎，这位同事一直保持着低姿态，所以有时候的输出会让人无法理解，又实在让人哭笑不得，甚至有时想想亏是在大家都很给力及早发现了问题吧，哈哈哈。他的头像使用的是这个：
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/yide.jpg" alt="yide.jpg"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
所以我们会叫他"益德" 😄
</p>

<p>
我个人很喜欢听他讲话，因为他的声音总让我想起"苗阜"，所以每次远程会议听到他说话我总感觉在听苗老师说话一样。
</p>

<p>
今天早上我们在准备 release demo 之后突然发现了一个问题就是最终的发布包里面少了一个文件，因为发布信息已经说了，所以需要抓紧重新做包，应该说这实在是正常 workload 之外的，而且想想重新 packaging 的过程和这么突然的要求大家都觉得很抱歉，听到"益德"在另一边还是像平常一样回答大家说："没关系的哈，这应该也是我能为大家做的最后一个包了。"
</p>

<p>
我数了下我今天调「一个人的书房」的代码时 Pipeline 失败了 27 次 🐶 最终就在刚刚躺下后突然想起来打开了 debug 然后就快速定位到了问题并且搞定了，明天 merge 过去。
</p>

<p>
这件事给我的教训就是不要过于相信自己对问题的理解，要不然还要 debug 干什么。

        <title>学习曲线</title>
        <link>https://note.jsntn.com/learning-curve.html</link>
        <guid></guid>
        <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
        <description><![CDATA[


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/learning-curve.png" alt="learning-curve.png"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
我想分享张图就是关于 Vim 和 Emacs 的学习曲线，是因为前天我的一个伙伴跟我说他安装了 Emacs，我当时就想到了这个图。
</p>

<p>
在这个蓝色的星球上，在编辑器领域，存在的这两条神奇的曲线，其背后的两股暗黑势力势如水火，分别守候着两大上古神器，不停地有新人进来，有旧人离开，但永远会有一些人通过了艰难的考验，留下来守护这两大神器……
</p>

<p>
说回这两条曲线，Vim 的曲线异常陡峭，但是当你度过了那一段艰难时期，就会从此天堑变通途；Emacs 则是初期似乎不过尔尔，但是学习愈深愈艰，而且还会出现回退，反复，360 度大回环等匪夷所思的情况，到最后你终于明白，Emacs 原来是个伪装成编辑器的操作系统，满眼都是泪！
</p>

<p>
（以上两段摘抄了池老师的文章，有修改）
</p>

<p>
另一点有趣的是，当你学会了 Vim 之后，你会发现你可以在绝大多数 Linux 发行版中游刃有余地进行文本操作；而当你学会了 Emacs 以后，却并不能保证你可以用明白第二个人的 Emacs，因为每一个人的 Emacs 都不一样。
</p>

<p>
以上，致我的小伙伴，和即将开始学习 Vim/Emacs 的同学。</p>]]></description>

我们这个工作 Windows 10 权限也不知道是怎么个回事，我一直的 bleeding-edge Emacs 好好地运行了一个多月了，今天重启了一下然后就打不开了……好在我同时还维护了一个 stable Emacs 实例在会议期间稳健地启动起来了，我觉得这件事告诉我一个道理我要记下来，就是-&#x2014;哪有什么 NB，不过是"稳"罢了。🐶</p>]]></description>

我就不解释在我 Kindle 用得越来越少的情况下为什么几乎不再买中文电子书了。
</p>

<p>
我去到了 Z-Library 这个很牛 x 的电子书下载站，挑着下载了那个最大的 4.72 MB 的《活着活着就老了》的 epub，然后导入到了 iOS 掌阅 iReader 中，应用“方正黑体”。
</p>

<p>
世界美好。

<p>
我说件事，我今天又一次因为 Emacs 的效率和设计震撼到了！
</p>

<p>
我就在想我更早就学了 Emacs 该有多好，然后我就陷入了思考-&#x2014;到底什么是一个好的编辑器设计？
</p>

<p>
一定不是花里胡哨的界面，因为 Emacs 的初始界面土的掉渣了，它的配置程序复杂的吓人，快捷键反人类，但是一旦完成了这些再愿意付出数月时间实践之后，它的效率会让你兴奋地忘记时间！等你反应过来了，半年也就这么过去了！
</p>

<p>
之后你会开始研究，什么插件呀，语法高亮呀，拼写检查呀，能给它开的都给它开着，就图两个字儿-&#x2014;沉浸。
</p>

<p>
整几行介绍出来，进程序就给他 print 出来，甭管你学没学过，默认第一句话就是：Press to enter the tutorial.
</p>

<p>
好的东西你得分享出来！琢磨着弄几个 workshop，教材一码 GNU 的，高端！慢慢周围哥几个不是用 Vim 就是 Emacs，你要用一 UltraEdit，你都不好意思跟人家打招呼。
</p>

<p>
你就说这么 NB 一东西，学会得用多长时间？
</p>

<p>
-&#x2014;我觉着怎么也得小半年儿吧。
</p>

<p>
-&#x2014;半年？入门都远着呢，能学会移动光标就不错了。你还别说耗不起，就不给你 GUI。你得研究极客的学习心理，汇编都学出来的人根本就不在乎学编辑器这点时间。</p>]]></description>

We never thought about giving up. We stood up for what the real value is. we fought for the right reason but without asking for payoff. We passed the brambles, the toughest time - for the right thing. We worked for the efficiency improvement, little by little, again and again, never compromise, never ever. We sacrificed, we cared about the end users, as we always believe - we are contributing ideas, we are building good things, and we can talk on same basis, act in agreement, make things happen together&#x2026;But we are on a lonely journey, I don't want to see it off-track and away from the right way, all because that's so important to me&#x2026;

Emacs 整一年，我得说它影响了我，就像东京一年的<a href="https://jsntn.com/essays/2017/01/22/japanese.html">日本人</a>于我一样。
</p>

<p>
从痴迷于新的发现，到明白其实完全不缺少新的事物，更重要的是去寻找的眼睛和把握当下的心。
</p>

<p>
这让我想到了林清玄说的三个境界：
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
第一个十年我才华横溢，「贼光闪现」，令周边黯然失色；第二个十年，我终于「宝光现形」，不再去抢风头，反而与身边的美丽相得益彰；进入第三个十年，繁华落尽见真醇，我进入了「醇光初现」的阶段，真正体味到了境界之美。
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
也是我老了。

放弃了后裔和虞姬，卸载了王者，可你真的忘得掉那段战斗的时光吗？平和岛，从横滨到蒲田，到品川，到田町，那不远的东京塔……你忘得掉兄弟们不抛弃不放弃，大声告诉你“不要管我们，往前冲”吗？京都的樱花又要开了，我们挥舞宝剑，在樱花树下纵情起舞，剑锋划过，无数樱花纷纷飘落……那四月物语的一个擦肩，和兄弟们的整个春天&#x2026;&#x2026;

<p>
这两天用 Emacs coding 的时候，本感觉我发现了一个 Emacs 在递归遍历和自动 hook 方面值得优化的地方，甚至起草好了 request 文档，反复打磨修辞。
</p>

<p>
做最后修饰和信息补充时，意外从 reddit 看到了一篇文章，里面详细描述了如何用原生方法实现我需要的功能……
</p>

<p>
在认真阅读了几遍并确认我们的理解没有偏差之后，安静地坐在电脑前面，我仿佛看到了 68 岁的 Richard Stallman 在地球的另一边，一只手捋着他的花白胡子，另一只手的大拇指轻轻点算，透过屏幕，微笑道：“年轻人，我都想到了。”
</p>

<p>
大佬贡献了极富艺术性的天才设计思想之后，端着咖啡，静静地演进和完善 GNU Emacs，供无数的追捧者使用、把玩、研究和膜拜。

每当我用心爱的 Vim 写 Shell 的时候，就会想起当年和狗哥在日本靠着窗边噼噼啪啪敲键盘的日子，累了一起去打杯咖啡，或者起身看看窗外，舒缓双眼就能延展到横滨上空。狗哥指着远处告诉我，那就是富士山。

<p>
项目中因为细节变更涉及到需求和实现的妥协，确定下来之后，收到日本同事这样一封邮件。
</p>

<p>
<a href="./images/the-japanese.jpg.gpg">ENCRYPTED IMAGE</a>
</p>

<p>
真的很难去形容这种感觉，我竟联想到的是前一段负责从武汉撤侨的日本内阁官员，虽然我们已经没办法知道他到底是因为什么……
</p>

<p>
日本人执着流程，忠于责任，并常常因此默默承担压力。

<p>
今天发布了第一个正式版的 DR package，我叫它 1.0。
</p>

<p>
8 个月，508 条 commits，都在其中。
</p>

<p>
我努力让它更健壮、逻辑更简洁、响应更清晰、交互更人性化，甚至在执行等待时加入了进度显示，多希望使用的人会说，哟！这比之前的版本好用了一些了呢。
</p>

<p>
能完整参与「设计」到「实现」是挑战，更是幸运。
</p>

<p>
这段回忆，我愿意重新经历一遍。
</p>

<p>
晚安！
</p>

#MAIL-RECORDED
</p>

<p>
拜拜！伙伴们。
</p>

<p>
转眼 9 个月就过去了，过得充实又开心。把期间的照片翻了一遍，不敢相信过得这么快，事实是 9 个月时间的相处真不算短。我会想念每一位小伙伴的。
</p>

<p>
少年有自己的想法，心思细密；尼克兄善于倾听有见地，懂得照顾心理；盖老师思维清晰，有坚持有性格；我眼中的 done 桑质直而好义。
</p>

<p>
离开不是永远，一切难说再见。
</p>

<p>
对了，开心最重要，心情不好时，去超市捏捏方便面。
</p>

<p>
此致

#日常吹牛逼
</p>

<p>
Cryptomator 从发布出来我就一直很关注，并且在「安卓果酱」上写过文章推荐它。
</p>

<p>
上周看到它要出 Cryptomator Server 了，我就发了封邮件，说了下我对 Cryptomator 的想法，然后对方回复我说要和我远程聊一下，结果今晚我就和两个德国人在线扯到现在……
</p>

<p>
两个年轻人如此真诚，我就点拨了两点：一是用 Docker；二是要支持 Dropbox 等网盘。
</p>

<p>
他俩说 10 天左右会发布出来一个新版本到时候发给我。
</p>

<p>
我现在觉得我已经牛 x 到德国了。
</p>

<p>
最后推一下 Cryptomator：

我今天用了 3 个多小时去公司每个楼层转了一圈，见了些正经的和不正经的同事。去 9 楼办了张黑卡，去 4 楼交易了点烟草，去 10 楼送了批药物，最后回去写了个小软件，然后就下班了。

刚看到邮件以前的经理离职了。
</p>

<p>
听说职场上的离职有两种情况：一种是在所工作的环境中实在呆不下去了，不得不选择离职来摆脱；另一种是在所工作的环境中已经得不到更多的发展和成长条件，甚至看得到若干年后的自己。除了这两种情况之外，倘若还有第三个原因，都不是正确的选择。
</p>

<p>
第一种是谁都不愿遇到的，第二种情况下，当事人往往有主观认为的更好的选择，即使是选择去开一家小小的店，追求简简单单、随性自由的生活。

<p>
时间已经带走了许多，包括熟悉、人情冷暖。不知道时间除了层层叠叠的痛、断断续续的裂痕，又带给我了冷漠，还是改变？人是不是总在经历很多之后变得圆滑？在拥有很多后，便忘了自己单纯的梦想与执着？

最近写 Emacs Lisp 代码的节奏和感觉非常好。

首先是上月底我发现有道词典的调用开始不好用了，于是 3 号写了一个功能直接本地 GoldenDict，彻底摆脱远端依赖。

然后 4 号那天我写了解密 GPG 文件的功能。
</p>

<p>
7 号我写了挂载 TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt Volume 的功能。

9 号我可以备份我的 straight.el repos 到我的 NAS 并检查 NAS 确保只存有最近的 10 个存档备份。

<p>
今天我可以取消挂载 Volume 了。

想到自己甚至还把那一年的经历记录成了一篇心得体会。

<p>
快速翻了一遍，看到第一段：
</p>

<p>
&gt; I'm not young anymore, and I always hope that I can produce something memorable.

笑到不行了 🤪

我开始更轻松地 commit 我的 .emacs.d 了（@github/jsntn/emacs.d），因为我现在终于理解了「过程」比「结果」重要，换句话说，什么才是最终的「结果」？这也不好定义。所以与其期待结果之后的成就感，不如享受过程中的点滴成长和进步。若「过程」是值得经历的，那么它就是值得记录的。

今天不得了了！我学到了太多有趣的东西。单说 Emacs，首先我了解到了我是完全可以使用 eshell over tramp 的（之前我都是用的 remote server 的 shell，存在 Tabnine 补全卡顿甚者 C-g 之后在 current session 就再也不好用的情况，等等）；其次在这个基础上，我知道了终止命令可以是 C-q C-c 而不需要再 list-process 然后 kill 掉，导致要重开 session；还有 eshell 的 C-up/down、Emacs 的 C-s 代替 reverse search 等等等等。😄

我还解决了 Hugo 的 invalid timezone 的问题；用 Emacs 和 Copilot 快速完成了段代码实现了 sticky post（网站文章置顶）的功能。

我跟老陈说 Emacs 我学得晚了，真的是太晚了，每每想到这我都感到焦虑，夜不能寐那种。老陈说你也不必这样，你还记得老李之前说过 I wish I had all the time I’d ever wasted, so I could waste it all over again 嘛？我们应该去享受过程不是吗？！我听了心里舒服多了。

对了，骇客邦 #30 已经寄出了，题目叫「人生苦短，要去折腾真正有意义的事情」。虽然意义众口难调，my honey and his arsenic, anyway, Substack, see you there. ❤️

需要把 700 多个文件重命名，涉及到删、改和部分大小写转换，这活儿按照我本来的想法是得整一个 shell 脚本跑一遍的，用 Emacs 初始化了脚本后我突然想到也许 Emacs 的 dired 模式下可以快速完成吧？于是进入了 dired，dired-toggle-read-only，再然后就是在其中直接 query-replace 和借用正则尽情翱翔了，最后 wdired-finish-edit 退出，完成。

全程约 7 分钟，含 Google 约 1 分钟，感动加感慨了约 2 分钟，实际操作约 4 分钟。

按理说已经学习了 2 年 Emacs，我应该非常平静和冷淡地看待这件事才是，但我仍无法淡定，因为我发现在 Emacs 面前我还是像个才入门的菜鸡一样。

2 年了，不能说急切，哥都焦虑了，夜不能寐那种。</p>
